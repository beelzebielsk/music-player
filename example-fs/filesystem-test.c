/* Tests:
 * - While your file system does not have to survive random crashes at
 *   this stage, it does have to maintain state persistently. In
 *   particular, it should be able to run, be powered down, and then
 *   be ``rebooted'' in the state that it was in when it was shutdown
 *   (i.e., all files that were written at shutdown time should still
 *   be there, and no garbage files should suddenly appear).
